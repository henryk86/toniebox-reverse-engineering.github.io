# Rules for our Chats and Forums - Community Guidelines

## Do's

### §1. Be respectful
Treat others with kindness and respect.

### §2. Complex questions
For in-depth inquiries, please use our [Forum](https://forum.revvox.de).

### §3. Stay on topic
This community is focused on Toniebox-related discussions.

### §4. Use English
To ensure everyone can participate, please stick to English. Messages in other languages are deleted without comment.

## Don'ts

### §5. No piracy
Any requests or discussions related to piracy will result in an immediate ban.

### §6. No team tagging
Don't tag the team for general questions. Replying is totally ok if we are already in the discussion. 

### §7. No general hacking
This is not a community for general hacking. Questions like "Can you hack Instagram?" or "How to crack Candy Crush?" result in a ban.

### §8. No self-promotion without permission
If you're a merchant, clearly identify yourself and ask permission before sharing links to your products.

### §9. Posting the same question in multiple places
Please stick to the [Forum](https://forum.revvox.de) if you started there. Scattering the answers in [Telegram](https://t.me/toniebox_reverse_engineering) and Discource will make it hard for others to find the solution.

### §10. No kidnapping of solved threads
If you find a thread in our [Forum](https://forum.revvox.de) that seems to be solved, don't hijack it for your problem. It may look similar, but this will end up in chaos. Open your own thread!

## Helpful Tips
- Use the search function before asking a question
- Be patient when waiting for responses
- Share your knowledge to help others

## Telegram
