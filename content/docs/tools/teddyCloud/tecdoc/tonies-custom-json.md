# tonies.custom.json
teddyCloud uses the `tonies.custom.json` file from `config` folder to read the metadata of custom tags in the same manner it's done for the official boxine tonies in the `tonies.json` file. The structure is the same, but it's not overwritten as the `tonies.json` file through regularly updates. So you can use the `tonies.custom.json` to save metadata of your own custom tags.

You can generate the required JSON data via teddyCloud GUI (Edit Tag / Create new model) and save it in the `tonies.custom.json` file, or you can generate it manually, as described below.

Initially the `tonies.custom.json` file looks like the following:

```
[]
```

In the GUI, a custom tag looks initially like:

Enriched with metadata for the above shown custom tag the `tonies.custom.json` file looks like this (more details see below in section [Specification](#specification)):

```json
[{"no": "0", "model": "123456", "audio_id": ["369519776"], "hash": ["af9e61a9c1b12138fb060908d595742334b04515"], "title": "Custom Tonie Example Title", "series": "Custom Tonies", "episodes": "This is my custom tonie", "tracks": ["Title 1", "Title 2", "Title 3", "Title 4", "Title 5", "Title 6", "Title 7", "Title 8", "Title 9", "Title 10"], "release": "0", "language": "de-de", "category": "custom", "pic": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Hello_Web_Series_%28Wordmark%29_Logo.png"}]
```

**Note:** After you changed the `tonies.custom.json` file you need to reload it via teddyCloud GUI ( Settings / Reload Tonies.json ) or restart the server.

This results after reloading of the `tonies.custom.json` file in the following changed appearance in the GUI:

Each element consists of a JSON object with the following keys:
